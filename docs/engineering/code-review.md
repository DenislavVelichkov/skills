## What it does

`code-review` reviews a frozen committed candidate against a supplied or evidence-derived baseline along two axes. Standards checks repository rules; Spec checks the originating requirements. Both run locally by default. Explicit authorization permits parallel read-only reviewers, each forbidden from delegating further.

The skill never merges or re-ranks the two axes. The report ends with a worst issue *per axis* and declines to name a single winner across them. A change can pass one axis and fail the other. Code that follows every convention but implements the wrong thing passes Standards and fails Spec. Code that does exactly what the [ticket](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/ticket) asked but breaks the repo's conventions does the reverse. A blended verdict lets the passing axis hide the failing one.

Audits and reviews inspect retained evidence without starting live scenarios.
Explicit validation shares verified assessments within the project's supported
operation, expires them after relevant changes, and records failed work as well
as successful reuse. Existing native and human acceptance gates still apply.

## When to reach for it

The first review covers the complete requested diff on a frozen candidate.
Follow-up reviews cover accepted fixes and their affected behavior, retaining
the original review coverage. Once both axes and required checks pass, an
unchanged scope does not need another review round.

Type `/code-review`, or the agent reaches for it automatically when you ask to review a branch, a PR, work in progress, or anything "since X".

| Your situation | Reach for |
| --- | --- |
| A diff exists and you want to know if it is built right *and* is the right thing | `code-review` |
| You want bugs hunted in the diff: null paths, races, off-by-one | Claude Code's own built-in review, not this one (see the name clash below) |
| Nothing is written yet and you want it written test-first | [tdd](https://aihero.dev/skills-tdd) |
| One approved ticket needs building, review included | [implement](https://aihero.dev/skills-implement), which calls this skill itself |
| The whole codebase has drifted, not one diff | [improve-codebase-architecture](https://aihero.dev/skills-improve-codebase-architecture) |
| Something is broken and you do not know why | [diagnosing-bugs](https://aihero.dev/skills-diagnosing-bugs) |

A supplied fixed point wins. Otherwise the review derives it from the recorded task-start commit, established PR base or verified upstream merge-base, in that order. It states the derivation and asks only when the evidence is missing or conflicting. It checks that the ref resolves and the diff is non-empty.

## Prerequisites

The Standards axis needs nothing. It reads whatever the repo documents (`CODING_STANDARDS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and the like) and falls back on a built-in baseline when the repo documents nothing.

The Spec axis needs a spec to exist and be findable. It looks in this order:

1. Issue references in the commit messages (`#123`, `Closes #45`, a GitLab `!67`), fetched through `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.
2. A path you pass in as an argument.
3. A spec file under `docs/`, `specs/`, or `.scratch/` matching the branch or feature name.
4. Asking you.

Step 1 depends on `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`, which [setup-matt-pocock-skills](https://aihero.dev/skills-setup-matt-pocock-skills) writes. Without it the axis still works if you hand it a path. With no spec at all, the skill skips the Spec sub-agent and the report says "no spec available" rather than inventing requirements.

## The two axes

| | Standards | Spec |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Question | Is it built right? | Is it the right thing? |
| Reads | The repo's documented standards, plus the smell baseline | The originating issue or spec |
| Reports | Documented breaches (can be hard), and smells (always judgement calls) | Missing or partial requirements, scope creep, requirements implemented wrongly |
| Every finding cites | The standards file and the rule, or the named smell plus the hunk | The line of the spec |

This design exists to avoid a generic review skill that does not know your standards. Such a skill flags what is deliberate in your codebase and misses the invariants your codebase depends on. So the repo's own documentation is the [primary source](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/primary-source) on the Standards axis, and **the repo always overrides**.

The **smell baseline** sits under the repo's standards. It is twelve code smells from chapter 3 of Fowler's _Refactoring_: Mysterious Name, Duplicated Code, Feature Envy, Data Clumps, Primitive Obsession, Repeated Switches, Shotgun Surgery, Divergent Change, Speculative Generality, Message Chains, Middle Man, Refused Bequest. Each is a labelled heuristic ("possible Feature Envy"), never a hard violation. Each states what the smell is and how to fix it, so a finding comes with a fix attached rather than only a complaint. Both axes skip anything your linter already enforces.

Visual acceptance is reported beside those axes, not added as a third one.
It applies only when the spec requires a production surface to be compared
against a visual reference, requires selecting that reference for the later
comparison, or links an existing manifest that records either obligation. A
visual diff without that obligation gets no visual-acceptance block. For an
applicable action, the review verifies hashes, reads the reference/candidate
comparison, and reports the five delivery counters. It cannot advance a human
gate.

## Common questions

**It collides with Claude Code's own `/code-review`. What do I do?**

This is the most reported problem with the skill, and it is not fixed. Claude Code ships its own `/code-review`, which does something different: it hunts bugs in the diff, where this one checks spec compliance and repo standards. When you install this library, one of them wins, and which one depends on how you installed:

- **Plugin marketplace.** Every skill gets a `mattpocock-skills:` prefix, and the built-in becomes hard to reach at the unqualified name.
- **Plain skills install.** The local file wins, and this skill shadows the built-in.

One answer is to remove Claude Code's built-in skills entirely. That saves a lot of [context](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/context), and the collision stops mattering. The shadowing itself is arguably a Claude Code [harness](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/harness) bug (a skill author should be free to name a skill anything), so the other answer is to rename the local copy. `npx skills update` undoes an edit to the frontmatter or a renamed directory. The durable workaround users report is to fork the skill to a new name and drop `code-review` from the managed set. Keep a note of the commit you forked from so you can re-sync by hand.

**Its sub-agents keep invoking `/code-review` again and spawn more agents.**

The review instructions prohibit recursive delegation. Parallel review requires explicit authorization; each reviewer receives one frozen axis and completes it directly.

**Should I run it in the same [session](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/session) that wrote the code?**

Prefer a fresh one. As one reader put it: "Same context reviewing itself isn't review, it's confirmation bias with a slash command." An agent that reviews in the authoring session has every assumption that shaped the code in its context. An independent reviewer would not have that context. This is also why people ask for [implement](https://aihero.dev/skills-implement) without its built-in review step, because that step runs the review inside the session that just wrote the diff. The independent version is to invoke `/code-review` yourself from a clean session.

**After every ticket, or once at the end?**

Review the integrated candidate against its full scope. After related fixes, review their delta and affected callers while retaining the original coverage. Broaden when shared changes or uncertain impact require it; unchanged bookkeeping alone does not restart a full review.

**Can I trust the findings?**

Not without checking. Sub-agent output is a hypothesis, not evidence. One team reported a dozen breaking changes that prose-based reviews had missed. The skill combines the two reports as they are, or lightly cleaned. It does not re-verify each claim against the files, so a finding can cite the wrong location or overstate an impact. Read the citation on each finding before you act on it. The skill requires every finding to carry a citation (a standards rule, a smell plus its hunk, or a spec line), and that is what makes the findings checkable.

**Why does it find new problems every single time I run it?**

Accepted fixes receive a delta review. Once both axes and required checks pass, stop reviewing that unchanged scope. Retain prior coverage and expand only when a change or uncertainty requires it.

**Does it review my uncommitted work?**

No. It diffs `<fixed-point>...HEAD`. The three-dot form measures from the merge-base and excludes staged and working-tree changes. If `implement` has not made an interim commit, the review cannot see the work that is about to go into the next commit. Commit first, then review, then amend or add a fixup.

## It's working if

- It refuses to start on a bad ref or an empty diff, before any sub-agent is spawned.
- The report arrives as two separate blocks under `## Standards` and `## Spec`, not one merged list.
- Every Standards finding names either a rule in one of your repo's files or one of the twelve smells, with the hunk quoted; every Spec finding quotes a line of the spec.
- The closing summary gives a worst issue per axis and declines to pick an overall winner.
- With no spec available, the Spec block says so instead of listing requirements it inferred from the code.
- With a visual parity action, the report preserves the manifest's exact state
  and never converts a clean review into Member acceptance or baseline
  promotion.

## Where it fits

`code-review` is the review step near the tail of the build chain: `grill-with-docs → to-spec → to-tickets → implement → code-review → retro`. It also stands alone on any branch or PR you point it at.

- [implement](https://aihero.dev/skills-implement) is the closest neighbour. It drives the build and calls this skill as a review of its committed integrated candidate. [implement-spec](https://aihero.dev/skills-implement-spec) does the same once, over the whole integration branch.
- [retro](https://aihero.dev/skills-retro) comes after it and tunes it. When a session shows the review missing a class of mistake, `retro` proposes the check or the `CODING_STANDARDS.md` rule the Standards axis then reads.
- [pr](https://aihero.dev/skills-pr) writes the pull request body once the reviewed work goes up.
- [to-spec](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-spec) and [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets) produce the document the Spec axis checks against, so a vague spec makes that axis vague.
- [improve-codebase-architecture](https://aihero.dev/skills-improve-codebase-architecture) is the whole-codebase counterpart, because this skill only looks at one diff.

[ask-matt](https://aihero.dev/skills-ask-matt) routes across the whole set when you are unsure which skill the situation wants.
